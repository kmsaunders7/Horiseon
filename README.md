This wepage was modified to make it more accessible for the user. In order to do this, we updated the "alt" terms after each image. In case the user was not able to see the image, an message would still appear to show what that image is supposed to be. 

Also, the css and html were updated to make it easier to read. The "div" items were replaced with better semantic usage.
